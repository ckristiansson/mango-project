# The Mango Project

This is a personal project where I try to implement one of my webbdesigns.

I wanted a very modern, sleek yet warm and inviting design that was easy to navigate. Therefore, I opted to use very few, soft colors and leave lots of air in the design.

Keep in mind this is a work in progress. Currently there is no functionality implemented. This project is primarily for me to hone my skills as a designer and developer.
